               <h2>BioGraphy</h2>
               <p>Virat Kohli (Hindustani: (About this soundlisten); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the India national team.<br> A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best contemporary batsmen in the world. He plays for Royal Challengers Banga-<br>lore in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and has been the team's captain since 2013. Kohli is consistently rated as one of the top-ranked batsmen in<br> the world,according to the ICC Player Rankings. Among Indian batsmen, Kohli has the best ever Test rating (937 points), ODI rating (911 points)<br> and T20I rating (897 points).

                Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a few months later, he<br> made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established<br> himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged<br> off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa. Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings<br> for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013, Kohli  also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC<br> World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).</p>
